# Space-Rocket
First try to make a rocket shooting game demo.
Originally made with PyCharm, with the addon Pygame. You can control the lil rocket and try to survive among the meteor rush. 
The more you kill, the more Meteor popup. With getting ahead, you can unlock Shield and double shoot aswell.
Controls: W,A,S,D left mouse right mouse click.
If you want to test it, the code was made in PyCharm, Pygame. I recommend to test it in it.
